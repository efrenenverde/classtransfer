('Hey Jude', 'The Beatles', "Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't… "),
('While My Guitar Gently Weeps', 'The Beatles', "I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't…" ),
('Let it Be', 'The Beatles', "When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

('Caminante no hay camino', 'Joan Manuel Serrat', 'Todo pasa y todo queda
Pero lo nuestro es pasar
Pasar haciendo caminos
Caminos sobre la mar

Nunca perseguí la gloria
Ni dejar en la memoria
De los hombres mi canción
Yo amo los mundos sutiles
Ingrávidos y gentiles
Como pompas de jabón

Me gusta verlos pintarse de sol y grana
Volar bajo el cielo azul
Temblar súbitamente y quebrarse
Nunca perseguí la gloria
Caminante son tus huellas el camino y nada más
Caminante, no hay camino se hace camino al andar

Al andar se hace camino
Y al volver la vista atrás
Se ve la senda que nunca
Se ha de volver a pisar
Caminante no hay camino sino estelas en la mar

Hace algún tiempo en ese lugar
Donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos
Se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar
Caminante no hay camino, se hace camino al andar

Golpe a golpe, verso a verso
Murió el poeta lejos del hogar
Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino
Al alejarse, le vieron llorar
Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar

Golpe a golpe, verso a verso
Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar
Cuando el poeta es un peregrino
Cuando de nada nos sirve rezar
Caminante no hay camino, se hace camino al andar

Golpe a golpe y verso a verso
Y golpe a golpe, vero a verso
Y golpe a golpe, verso a verso' ),

('Mediterraneo', 'Joan Manuel Serrat', 'Quizá porque mi niñez sigue jugando en tu playa
Y escondido tras las cañas duerme mi primer amor
Llevo tu luz y tu olor por donde quiera que vaya
Y amontonado en tu arena guardo amor, juegos y penas

Yo que en la piel tengo el sabor amargo del llanto eterno
Que han vertido en ti cien pueblos, de Algeciras a Estambul
Para que pintes de azul sus largas noches de invierno
A fuerza de desventuras tu alma es profunda y oscura

A tus atardeceres rojos se acostumbraron mis ojos
Como el recodo al camino
Soy cantor, soy embustero
Me gusta el juego y el vino, tengo alma de marinero
¿Qué le voy a hacer si yo nací en el Mediterráneo?
Nací en el Mediterráneo

Y te acercas, y te vas después de besar mi aldea
Jugando con la marea te vas, pensando en volver
Eres como una mujer perfumadita de brea
Que se añora y que se quiere, que se conoce y se teme

Ay… si un día para mi mal viene a buscarme la parca
Empujad al mar mi barca con un levante otoñal
Y dejad que el temporal desguace sus alas blancas
Y a mí enterradme sin duelo entre la playa y el cielo

En la ladera de un monte, más alto que el horizonte
Quiero tener buena vista
Mi cuerpo será camino
Le daré verde a los pinos y amarillo a la ceniza

Cerca del mar, porque yo nací en el Mediterráneo
Nací en el Mediterráneo
Nací en el Mediterráneo' ),

('La mujer que yo quiero', 'Joan Manuel Serrat', 'La mujer que yo quiero, no necesita bañarse cada noche en agua bendita. Tiene muchos defectos, dice mi madre, y demasiados huesos, dice mi padre. Pero ella es más verdad que el pan y la tierra. Mi amor es un amor de antes de la guerra para saberlo... La mujer que yo quiero, no necesita deshojar cada noche una margarita. La mujer que yo quiero, es fruta jugosa prendida en mi alma como si cualquier cosa. Con ella quieren dármela mis amigos, y se amargan la vida mis enemigos... porque sin querer tú, te envuelve su arrullo y contra su calor, se pierde el orgullo y la vergüenza... La mujer que yo quiero, es fruta jugosa madurando feliz, dulce y vanidosa. La mujer que yo quiero, me ató a su yunta, para sembrar la tierra de punta a punta de un amor que nos habla con voz de sabio y tiene de mujer la piel y los labios. Son todos suyos mis compañeros de antes...
Mi perro, mi Escalectric y mis amantes. Pobre JUANITO... La mujer que yo quiero, me ató a su yunta: pero, por favor, no se lo digas nunca. Pero, por favor, no se lo digas nunca...' ),

('The Last Time', 'Rolling Stones', "Find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,
Right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,
And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better
Right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
This is the last time I let you in my door,
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh, oh, oh,
This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I'm asking you this (this is the last time I'm asking you this)

('Satisfaction', 'Rolling Stones', "I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm drivin' in my car, and the man come on the radio

Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try

How white my shirts can be
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me
Baby, better come back maybe next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey

('Sympathy For The Devil', 'Rolling Stones', "Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
(Woo woo, woo woo)
I shouted out,
'Who killed the Kennedys?'
When after all
It was you and me
(Who who, who who)
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
(Woo woo, who who)
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
(Who who)
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby
(Who who, who who)
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
(Woo woo, who who)
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
(Who who, who who)
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
(Woo woo)
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah

Is the nature of my game, mm mean it, get down

She loves the theater, but she never comes late

I love to row boat with you and your wife on Central Park lake
She goes to Opera and stays wide awake (yes, I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp
